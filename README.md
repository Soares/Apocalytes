This is a variant of the board game RISK that I found suggested on the
internet, and honed with friends. The basic premise is that you roll a die, one
of six apocalypses occurs, and then you (and some friends) play risk against
the board.

The pdf is the prettiest version of the rules. The rules are easier edited in
the .odt and the text file. I'm not sure why both are here, or which one is
more recent. This project is quite old; I only recently dug it up.

The rules are fairly solid and play is quite fun, but the game still needs
significant play testing. Don't hesitate to tweak the rules if it makes things
more fun.
