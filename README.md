This is a variant of RISK that I found suggested on the internet, and honed
with friends. The basic premise is that you roll a die, one of six apocalypses
occurs, and then you (and some friends) play risk against the board.

I'm not sure what all of the files in this directory do, but at least one of
them is a relatively solid rule-set. It still needs some balance and some
tuning. Don't hesitate to change things up.
